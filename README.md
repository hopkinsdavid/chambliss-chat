Hey, welcome to this project!
- I am David, a senior at Covenant College studying Computer Science and Economics!

Purpose of the Software/Web Application:
- Previously, Chambliss Center for Children had the struggle to use paper forms to match the donor and sponsorâ€™s needs. Furthermore, this problem struggled with the idea that it has to be anonymous. For example, if the receiver needs to get a blanket from the sponsor, the sponsor needs to know what size, how many, what color, etc. Here, an  anonymous chat interaction between sponsors (who gives gifts/donors) and receivers software will be built. The job of the software is to provide effective and efficient chat/communication between the sponsors and receivers.
